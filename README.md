# Naive Bayes on Iris and SMS Spam Detection

## 📖 Description

This project applies Naive Bayes to:

Classify flower species in the Iris dataset

Detect spam in SMS messages

## 🧠 Model Explanation

Naive Bayes uses Bayes' Theorem with strong independence assumptions between features. It's fast and ideal for text classification.

It is a classification algorithm based on probability.

🎯 Goal of Naive Bayes?

We use this to predict the class (like "Spam" or "Not Spam") based on some input features (like words in an email).

Common Use Cases:

Spam filters

Sentiment analysis

Document classification

Medical diagnosis (e.g., predicting disease based on symptoms)

## ✅ Benefits

Extremely fast and efficient

Performs well in high-dimensional text data

## ⚠️ Limitations

Assumes feature independence (rare in real life)

May underperform with correlated features

## 📊 Datasets

Iris Dataset: Flower classification (scikit-learn)

SMS Spam Dataset: Text classification (labelled as spam or ham)
